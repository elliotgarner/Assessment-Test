# Assessment Test

I've not built many applications in SwiftUI.  I decided to challenge myself and become more familiar with building SwiftUI applications with the assessment by using plain SwiftUI instead of TCA for this application.  

The GitHub API is actually super awkward to use with the way they decided to do pagination.  
That being said, I'm very satisfied with the solution I came up with in my API provider.
